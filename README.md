This is the source of my Roblox Script Hub, Noob Hub. 

### <s>Reasons it's not obfuscated
- Free obfuscators are destroying my script and are very easy to decompile. :/
- Paid obfuscators are obviously goated, but I'm broke so I can't use them.

> I need help from someone that has a paid obfuscator, like Luraph or something. I just want them to obfuscate the script for me so skids can't steal my hard work.

## ðŸ¤“ Dear skids
As long as you give me credits, it's all good.

If not. I hope you end up on the streets begging for spare change.
